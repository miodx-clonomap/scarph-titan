# Scarph-Titan 

This project is an implementation of the [Scarph](https://github.com/ohnosequences/scarph) evaluation interface for [TitanDB](http://thinkaurelius.github.io/titan/). You can use Scarph DSL to write your graph-queries, check them for correctness at compile-time and then evaluate them somewhere else on a TitanDB graph using this project.
